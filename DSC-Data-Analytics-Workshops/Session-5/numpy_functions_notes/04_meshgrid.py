NumPy: meshgrid

- np.meshgrid(x, y) generates coordinate matrices for a grid.
- Useful in plotting surfaces.

Example 1: Creating a grid from x=[1,2,3], y=[4,5]
"""

import numpy as np

x = np.array([1,2,3])
y = np.array([4,5])

X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y) # creates **all combinations** of `x` and `y`. 
print("X Grid:\n", X)
print("Y Grid:\n", Y)


# X Grid:
#  [[1 2 3]
#  [1 2 3]]

# Y Grid:
#  [[4 4 4]
#  [5 5 5]]


# That means the coordinate pairs are:

# (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)

why we need meshgrid?

Great question ðŸ™Œ â€” `np.meshgrid` is often confusing until you **see it visually**.
Letâ€™s go step by step and show why we need it, with a **graphical explanation**.

---

### ðŸ”Ž What does `meshgrid` do?

When you have two arrays:

```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [4, 5]
```

* `meshgrid` creates **all combinations** of `x` and `y`.
* Instead of just having `(x,y)` separately, you get a **grid of coordinates**.

```python
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
```

* `X` repeats the `x` values for each row.
* `Y` repeats the `y` values for each column.

So:

```
X = [[1 2 3]
     [1 2 3]]

Y = [[4 4 4]
     [5 5 5]]
```

That means the coordinate pairs are:

```
(1,4), (2,4), (3,4),
(1,5), (2,5), (3,5)
```

---

### ðŸ“Š Why do we need this?

Because many tasks (like **plotting surfaces**, **evaluating functions over a 2D plane**) need every **pair of (x,y)**, not just separate arrays.

Example:
Letâ€™s plot a function `z = x^2 + y^2` both **with** and **without** meshgrid.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
y = np.array([4, 5])

# Meshgrid
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
Z = X**2 + Y**2

# Plot the grid points
plt.figure(figsize=(6,6))
plt.scatter(X, Y, c='red', s=100)
for i in range(X.shape[0]):
    for j in range(X.shape[1]):
        plt.text(X[i,j]+0.1, Y[i,j], f"({X[i,j]},{Y[i,j]})")

plt.title("Points generated by meshgrid")
plt.xlabel("X")
plt.ylabel("Y")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

---

### âœ… Interpretation

* Without `meshgrid`, you only have `x` values `[1,2,3]` and `y` values `[4,5]`.
* With `meshgrid`, you get the **grid of coordinates**:

  ```
  (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)
  (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)
  ```
* This is necessary to evaluate or plot functions on a **2D surface**, like drawing contour plots or 3D surfaces.
